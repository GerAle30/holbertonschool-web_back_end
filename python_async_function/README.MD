# 📦 Python Async Function

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum, designed to introduce asynchronous programming in Python using `async`/`await` syntax and the `asyncio` module. You’ll learn how to write concurrent code that performs non-blocking operations efficiently.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly:

- ✅ `async` and `await` syntax in Python
- ✅ How to execute asynchronous programs with `asyncio`
- ✅ Running concurrent coroutines and creating `asyncio` tasks
- ✅ Using the `random` module to simulate delay
- ✅ Managing concurrency using `asyncio.gather` and `create_task`
